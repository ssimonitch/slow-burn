# Slow Burn App

React + Vite workspace for the Slow Burn mobile-first PWA. Follow the bootstrap plan in `docs/04_platform/00-bootstrap-plan.md` for setup steps.

## Current Status
- Vite scaffold cleaned and wired with `@` path alias.
- Tailwind CSS config and PostCSS placeholders ready for dependency install.
- App shell stubs pending implementation (see `src/app/AppShell.tsx`).

No packages have been installed yet; run `pnpm install` once we are ready to execute the full bootstrap.
